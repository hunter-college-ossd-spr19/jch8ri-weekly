Hello,
This is a blog for an open source course that I am taking at Hunter college in Spring 2019. I will update these blogs weekly until the end of semester about any assignments and contributions that I make to the open source world. Updates will probably not be as frequent after that but I will try my best to inform everyone if I ever do something open source noteworthy. Thanks for checking in!
