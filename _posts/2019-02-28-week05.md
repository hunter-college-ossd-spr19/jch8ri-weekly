## **Assessing Roles And Finalizing Projects**

Hello,
so I still haven't found a project that I want to work on for the course. But I feel like it's mostly due to the fact that I don't understand a lot about most of these projects. The code bases and the complexity of the code is unlike anything I have seen. I just don't understand the code base to be able to fix bugs and contribute to the projects. The only projects that I have worked on in my entire college career are the ones from classes and those were very elementary and could be fairly easily solved as inefficient as my code was. But still this level of complexity is really intimidating for a novice like me. So if I do happen to be assigned to a project with other members in a team, I would try my best to contribute code to the project but still I'd be happy to do documentation, maintaining and all the organizational stuff and take this as an experience for next time. I'm not confident enough in my abilities to code and I feel like I'll just end up spending all semester just trying to understand the code base before fixing any issues. So yeah, I'm trying my best in this course despite lagging behind on so many assignments but I'm still completing them. As for what project I'm going to be working on, I guess we'll know by next week and what role I'll be playing in the team. That's all for this week. Thanks for checking in!
