## **OpenStreetMaps**

I made a small contribution to [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org) and made a few changes around the area where I live. I updated the names of a few buildings and locations based on the current businesses that are taking up the space. I also modified a few stop signs and traffic lights to include descriptions such as "traffic cameras present"([link](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/66920176)). I also added some detailed information about the church I attend frequently with the address of the place, service times and such([link](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/66920048)). I will return with more changes added next time. Thanks for checking in!
